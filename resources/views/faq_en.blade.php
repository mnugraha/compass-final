                    <p>The Compass contains Indorama’s purpose, vision, capabilities, and values; it is our DNA. It informs
                        internal and external stakeholders about why we exist, what we stand for, what differentiates us,
                        and how we engage with each other. Put simply, it is who we are.</p>

                    <p>The Compass will help you understand the purpose, vision, capabilities and values of Indorama. It
                        shapes our strategy, daily operations and interactions with each other. It shapes how we behave and

                    <p>No, the Compass and our values should be followed everywhere we go because we, as part of Indorama,
                        always represent the organization. Any irresponsible action, whether we are on duty or not, reflects
                        poorly on us and can damage our company’s reputation.</p>

                    <p>Competencies are a set of individual behaviours which are observable, measurable and critical to
                        successful individual and organizational performance. Indorama’s competency framework consists of 12
                        competencies that are applicable for all employees at different levels and functions.</p>

                    <p>We developed a customized framework for Indorama by working with The Chemistry Group, a leading

                    <p>A competency framework defines the behaviors that determine performance excellence and success at an
                        organization. Indorama’s competency framework consists of 12 critical competencies that apply to
                        various roles in the organization. They are also connected with Indorama’s 4 core values because
                        values and competencies go together.</p>

                    <p>Skills are the specific learned abilities that you need to perform a given job well. Competencies, on
                        the other hand, are the person’s knowledge and behaviors that lead them to be successful in a job
